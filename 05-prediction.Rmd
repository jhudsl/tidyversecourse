Modeling:

* lm

* glm

* glm.nb (for the firearms case study)

## Case Studies

Now that we understand more about modeling, let's take a look at our case studies again. 

Thus far, we have read the data into R,  wrangled the data into a usable format, and explored the data using visualizations. Now, we will use modeling to better understand if there are associations between variables in our data!

Let's start by loading our wrangled tidy data that we previously saved:

```{r}
load(here::here("data", "tidy_data", "case_study_1_tidy.rda"))

load(here::here("data", "tidy_data", "case_study_2_tidy.rda"))
```

### Case Study #1: Health Expenditures

Recall that we wanted to evaluate the following questions of interest using a health care dataset (`hc`):

1. Is there a relationship between healthcare coverage and healthcare spending in the United States?
2. How does the spending distribution change across geographic regions in the United States?
3. Does the relationship between healthcare coverage and healthcare spending in the United States change from 2013 to 2014?

```{r}
# see health care data
hc
```



### Case Study #2: Firearms

Recall that we wanted to evaluate the following questions of interest using data related to firearm legislation and fatal police shootings (`firearm`):

We are interested in the following question: 

>At the state-level, what is the relationship between firearm legislation strength and annual rate of fatal police shootings?

```{r}
# see firearms data
firearms
```

AVOCADO - this is a repeat.. maybe thats ok?

Recall that this dataset contains state level information about firearm ownership (broken down by ethnicity and gender), the population of each state (`total_pop`), the number of violent crimes (`violent_crime`), the “total state points” from the Brady Scorecard (`brady_scores`), the number of gunshots (`gunshot_tally`), the number of gunshots from armed, non-white, male individuals (`gunshot_filtered`), the annualized rate per 1,000,000 residents (`gunshot_rate`), the `unemployment rate` and `unemployment_rank`, population density (`density`), and firearm ownership as a percent of firearm suicides to all suicides (`ownership`).
