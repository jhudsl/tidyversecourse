## Tidy Data

Tidy datasets, by design, are easier to manipulate, model, and visualize. By starting with data that are already in a tidy format *or* by spending the time at the beginning of a project to get data into a tidy format, the remaining steps of your data science project will be easier.

### Data Terminology

Before we move on, let's discuss what is meant by **observations**, **variables**, and **types**, all of which are used to explain the principles of tidy data.

**Variables**

Variables in a spreadsheet are the different categories of data that will be collected. They are the different pieces of information that can be collected or measured on each person. Here, we see there are 7 different variables: ID, LastName, FirstName, Sex, City, State, and Occupation. The names for variables are put in the first row of the spreadsheet.

**Observations**

The measurements taken from a person for each variable are called observations. Observations for each individual are stored in a single row, with each observation being put in the appropriate column for each variable.

**Types**

Often, data are collected for the same individuals from multiple sources. For example, when you go to the doctor's office, you fill out a survey about yourself. That would count as one type of data. The measurements a doctor collects at your visit, however, would be a different type of data.

### Principles of Tidy Data

1. Each variable you measure should be in one column.


![Principle #1 of Tidy Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54/export/png?id=1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54&pageid=g326e316938_0_44)

2. Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row.


![Principle #2 of Tidy Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54/export/png?id=1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54&pageid=g326e316938_0_36)

3. There should be one spreadsheet for each "type" of data.


![Principle #3 of Tidy Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54/export/png?id=1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54&pageid=g326e316938_0_57)

4. If you have multiple spreadsheets, they should include a column in each spreadsheet (with the same column label!) that allows them to be joined or merged.


![Principle #4 of Tidy Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54/export/png?id=1JTG8Kt9htfyNsGQcsleHZNNXHKLe1zUlOb-SsnVNf54&pageid=g326e316938_0_40)

## Tidy Data Benefits

## From Non-Tidy --> Tidy

We've just spent a while discussing the principles of tidy data as well as a number of guidelines on how to correctly enter data into spreadsheets. At this point, you may think "I got it. Make my data rectangular! I'll do it." But, the reality is that most data are untidy. If you are not the one entering the data but are instead handed the data from someone else to do a project, more often than not, those data will be untidy. Untidy data are often referred to simply as messy data.

The following common problems seen in messy data sets again come from [Hadley Wickham's paper on tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). After briefly reviewing what each common problem is, we will then take a look at a few messy data sets. We'll finally touch on the concepts of tidying untidy data, but we won't actually do any practice *yet*. That's coming soon! 

### Common problems with messy data sets

1. Column headers are values but should be variable names.
2. A single column has multiple variables.
3. Variables have been entered in both rows and columns.
4. Multiple "types" of data are in the same spreadsheet.
5. A single observation is stored across multiple spreadsheets.

### Examples of untidy data

To see some of these messy datasets, let's explore three different sources of messy data.

#### Examples from [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://peerj.com/preprints/3183/)

In each of these examples, we see the principles of tidy data being broken. Each variable is not a unique column. There are empty cells all over the place. The data are not rectangular. Data formatted in these messy ways are likely to cause problems during analysis.


![Examples from Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SS0PYUE9_dE1MIWt6CZePEMUFL2P2Zy_3BidNWSq7hs/export/png?id=1SS0PYUE9_dE1MIWt6CZePEMUFL2P2Zy_3BidNWSq7hs&pageid=g2bfdb07292_0_151)

For a specific example, [Miles McBain](https://milesmcbain.github.io/), a data scientist from Brisbane, Australia set out to analyze Australian survey data on Same Sex marriage. Before he could do the analysis, however, he had a lot of tidying to do. He annotated all the ways in which the data were untidy, including the use of commas in numerical data entry, blank cells, junk at the top of the spreadsheet, and merged cells. All of these would have stopped him from being able to analyze the data had he not taken the time to first tidy the data. Luckily, he wrote a [Medium piece](https://medium.com/@miles.mcbain/tidying-the-australian-same-sex-marriage-postal-survey-data-with-r-5d35cea07962) including all the steps he took to tidy the data.

Inspired by Miles' work, Sharla Gelfand decided to tackle a messy data set from Toronto's open data. She similarly outlined all the ways in which the data were messy including, names and address across multiple cells in the spreadsheet, merged column headings, and lots of blank cells. She has also included the details of how she cleaned these data [in a blog post](https://sharlagelfand.netlify.com/posts/tidying-toronto-open-data/). While the details of the code may not make sense yet, it will shortly as you get more comfortable with the programming language, R.

### Tidying untidy data

There are a number of actions you can take on a dataset to tidy the data depending on the problem. These include: filtering, transforming, modifying variables, aggregating the data, and sorting the order of the observations. There are functions to accomplish each of these actions in R. While we'll get to the details of the code in a few lessons, it's important at this point to be able to identify untidy data and to determine what needs to be done in order to get those data into a tidy format. Specifically, we will focus in here on a single messy data set. This is dataset D from the 'Data Organization in Spreadsheets' example of messy data provided above. We note the blank cells and that the data are not rectangular.


![Messy data set](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SS0PYUE9_dE1MIWt6CZePEMUFL2P2Zy_3BidNWSq7hs/export/png?id=1SS0PYUE9_dE1MIWt6CZePEMUFL2P2Zy_3BidNWSq7hs&pageid=g326b2fc90a_0_22)

To address this, these data can be split into two different spreadsheets, one for each type of data. Spreadsheet A included information about each sample. Spreadsheet B includes measurements for each sample over time. Note that both spreadsheets have an 'id' column so that the data can be merged if necessary during analysis. The 'note' column does have some missing data. Filling in these blank cells with 'NA' would fully tidy these data. We note that sometimes a single spreadsheet becomes two spreadsheets during the tidying process. This is OK as long as there is a consistent variable name that links the two spreadsheets!

## Summary

When it comes to thinking about tidy data, remember that tidy data are rectangular data. The data should be a rectangle with each variable in a separate column and each entry in a different row. All cells should contain some text, so that the spreadsheet looks like a rectangle with something in every cell.
